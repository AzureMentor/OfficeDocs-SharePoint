# Deploy and configure the new OneDrive sync client for Mac

This article is for IT administrators managing OneDrive for Business settings in work or school environments. If you're not an IT administrator, read [Get started with the new OneDrive sync client on Mac OS X](https://support.office.com/article/d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f).
  
## Manage OneDrive settings on macOS using property list (Plist) files

Use the following keys to preconfigure or change settings for your users. The keys are the same whether you run the store edition or the standalone edition of the sync client, but the property list file name and domain name will be different. When you apply the settings, make sure to target the appropriate domain depending on the edition of the sync client.
  
||**Standalone**|**Mac App Store**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|PList Location  <br/> |~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.OneDrive.plist  <br/> |~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac/Data/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac.plist  <br/> |
|Domain  <br/> |com.microsoft.OneDrive  <br/> |com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac  <br/> |
   
## Deploy the sync client settings

Deploy the settings on macOS in the typical way:
  
1. Quit the OneDrive application.
    
2. Define the settings you want to change by creating a Plist with the values, or use a script to set the default values.
    
3. Deploy the settings onto the local computer.
    
4. Refresh the preferences cache.
    
    On the next start of OneDrive, the new settings will be picked up.

The following table lists all the settings that are currently exposed for the OneDrive sync client. You need to configure the parameters in parentheses.
