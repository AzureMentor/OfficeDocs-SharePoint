# Query and set Files On-Demand states

With OneDrive Files On-Demand, files can be in one of three states. Each of these states corresponds to a file attribute state.
To query the current state of a file or folder, use the following commands:

- Windows: attrib <Path to file or folder>
- Mac: /Applications/OneDrive.App/Contents/MacOS/OneDrive /getpin <Path to file or folder>

## Scriptable commands

Use the following commands to set file and folder states.
 
|**Files On-Demand state**|**File attribute state**|**Windows command**|**Mac command**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|Always available	<br/> |Pinned	<br/> |attrib +p <path\><br/> |	/Applications/OneDrive.App/Contents/MacOS/OneDrive /setpin <path\><br/> |
|Locally available 	<br/> |Clearpin	<br/> |attrib -p <path\>	<br/> |/Applications/OneDrive.App/Contents/MacOS/OneDrive /clearpin <path\>|
|Online-only	<br/> |Unpinned	<br/> |attrib +u <path\><br/> |	/Applications/OneDrive.App/Contents/MacOS/OneDrive /unpin <path\>|

 > [!NOTE]
> To set the file attribute state for all items within a folder on Mac, add the /r parameter.<br>Pinning an online-only file makes the sync client download the file contents, and unpinning a downloaded file frees up space on the device by not storing the file contents locally.<br>
To set an online-only file or folder to "locally available," you must first set it to "always available."
 
<br/>Meet [Windows and OneDrive sync client requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/OneDrive/per-machine-installation) and still can't see Files On-Demand option available at "Settings"? Make sure service "Windows Cloud Files Filter Driver" start type is set to 2 (AUTO_START). Enabling this feature sets the following registry key value to 2.
[HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\CldFlt]"Start"="dword:00000002"
