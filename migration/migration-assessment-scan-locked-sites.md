# Migration Assessment Scan: Locked Sites

Learn how to mitigate issues with Locked Sites during migration.
  
## Overview

When a site is configured as "No Access" in SharePoint, the site is inaccessible by both users and the system. As a result, the various pre-migration scans are configured to ignore any site that is configured as "No Access". It is **locked**. 
  
## Data Migration

Locked sites cannot be migrated to the target environment, as the migration tooling is unable to read the site contents.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint will be skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Ensure the list of locked sites is correct. If you have sites that are incorrectly marked as "No Access", update the lock status to "Not Locked".
  
## Post Migration

To manage the lock status on sites on the target environment, leverage the SharePoint Online Management Shell.
  
 **How to unlock a site collection on vNext**
  
1. Use the Set-SPSite cmdlet from the PowerShell cmdlets to unlock sites.
    
2. Download the cmdlets from the [SharePoint Online Management Shell download.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588 
    
3. Launch SharePoint Management Shell
    
4. Run:  `Set-SPSite -LockStatus Unlock`
    
 **How to set a site to "No Access"**
  
1. Use Set-SPSite from the PowerShell cmdlets to lock sites. This is similar to "No Access" in that users can't get to the site.
    
2. Download the cmdlets from the [SharePoint Online Management Shell download.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588) https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35588 
    
3. Launch SharePoint Management Shell
    
4. Run:  `Set-SPSite -LockStatus NoAccess`
    
 **How to set a site to "Read only"**
  
1. Set-SPSite does not support setting a site to "Read Only". An alternative method is to use Site Collection Policies on a site collection.
    
2. Browse the site you want to be "Read Only".
    
3. Click the gear icon in the top right, select Site Settings
    
4. Click Site Policies
    
5. Click Create
    
  - a. Enter a Name and Description
    
  - Select "Do not close or delete site automatically"
    
  - Check "The site collection will be read only when it is closed"
    
  - Click OK
    
6. On Site Settings, click Site Closure and Deletion
    
1. For Site Policy, select the "Read Only" policy from Step 4
    
2. Click OK
    
3. Go back into Site Closure and Deletion and click Close this site now The site is now "Read Only"
    
4. Only a site collection admin can access and click Open this site.
