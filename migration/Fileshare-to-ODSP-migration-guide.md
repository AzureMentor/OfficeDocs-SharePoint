# File share to OneDrive and SharePoint Migration Guide
This guide will help you prepare to migrate from File shares to OneDrive and SharePoint in Office 365.

Most migrations fall into regular phases as described below.  Proven success factors for migration include planning, assessing and remediating, preparing your target environment, migrating and onboarding your users. 

**Note:**</br>The SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) is a Microsoft developed migration tool available at no cost. To download: [SharePoint Migration Tool ](https://aka.ms/spmt-ga-page).

## File shares
File shares include centralized file hosting on a network server or a network drive or shared files or disks on a local computer.  Often referred to as a “Z drive” on networked computers, it is a shared drive somewhere on the network. 


## Migration planning
Before beginning your migration, it is important that you plan your outcome by performing an assessment of your current source environment. What you discover will influence your overall strategy and timing, including:
- The design of the target environment and the mapping between source and target systems. 
- The amount of content you migrate. Determine if content is redundant, out of date, or still relevant.
- Build your user onboarding into your upfront planning. Communicate early and often with your users about the migration and how it will impact them. Don't wait until the very end to start preparing them for the change.


### What’s Migrated?
When preparing for your file share migration, it is important to know what is being migrated when you use the SharePoint Migration Tool and what is not.

|**Migrated**|**Not Migrated**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Documents|Conversion of embedded URLs in content|
|File and folder structure|Windows hidden attributes on file and folder|
|User level file and folder permissions|Explicit deny permissions|
|Files under 15 GB|Inaccessible or corrupted documents| 
|Site, document, and folder metadata|Files or folders exceeding current SharePoint Online restrictions and limitations|  


### What content goes where
Include in your planning how to make this transition to Office 365 will make for a more collaborative experience for your users.
 
Review how you use the content stored in your file shares today. Does the file belong to a single user, even though they may share it with others? If so, save it in your OneDrive. Your OneDrive is private by default, but you can share files with others, which is particularly useful if you aren’t working as a team yet.

If you’re working on a file or folder intended for team consumption and collaboration, move it to a **shared library** where team members have access by default. OneDrive gives you access to all your shared libraries in Microsoft Teams, SharePoint or Outlook. When you need a new shared library for team files, you can create on right from OneDrive, add members, and start working together.

### Permissions vs Sharing

How you have shared your files will dictate how they appear in the Shared with Me view in OneDrive.

Files and folders that you have opened from a shared location
- After migration, the final permission level is determined by a mapping of the most restrictive share or NTFS permission level. 
- A user’s **Shared with me** folder in OneDrive for Business won’t be updated for source files shared with a group the user is a part of.
- After migration, all advanced NTFS permissions are removed. For explicit deny permissions, this means the content is subject to parallel permissions or permission on the folder and parent level and may become accessible.

|**Windows file share permissions**|**SharePoint item access**|**SharePoint role**|

|Full control|Full control|Contribute|
|Modify|Modify|	Contribute|
|Read and execute|Read and execute|Read|
|List folder contents|List folder contents|Read|
|Read|Read|Read|
|Write|Write|Contribute|




## Assess and remediate your content
Before beginning your migration, it is important that you perform an analysis of your current environment. Only you know your data and how and who uses it.
 
The SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT) provides the ability to scan your files and provide assessment reports .  To find any issues with your file before migration, turn on the setting **Only perform scanning**.

If you have multiple sources you wish to assess, consider using the bulk process by creating a .JSON or .CSV file.

Here are some of the more common issues that arise when preparing for migration:


| |**Assess**|**Remediate**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|**File extensions**|Find all files in the Folders and Files report whose Path ends in one of the extensions defined here: [Types of files that cannot be added to a list or library](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Types-of-files-that-cannot-be-added-to-a-list-or-library-30BE234D-E551-4C2A-8DE8-F8546FFBF5B3)|If the blocked file types are scripting files, they are blocked because scripting capabilities are turned off by default in OneDrive. <br><br>If you want to allow these file types, turn on scripting capabilities as described here: [Allow or prevent custom script](/sharepoint/allow-or-prevent-custom-script). <br><br>Make sure you understand why these files are blocked by default as described here: [Security considerations of allowing custom script](/sharepoint/security-considerations-of-allowing-custom-script)|
|**File and folder name characters**|Find all items in the Folders and Files report whose name contains any of the characters detailed here: [Invalid file names and file types in OneDrive, OneDrive for Business, and SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa)|Work with your migration vendor to substitute these characters in all file and folder names.<br><br>**Note:** The # and % characters are supported but not enabled by default. Follow these steps to enable them: [New support for # and % in SharePoint Online and OneDrive](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-SharePoint-Blog/New-support-for-and-in-SharePoint-Online-and-OneDrive-for/ba-p/60357)|
|**File and folder path length**|Find all items in the *Folders and Files* report whose Path exceeds the file path length described here: [SharePoint Online limits](/office365/servicedescriptions/sharepoint-online-service-description/sharepoint-online-limits)|Work with your migration vendor to reorganize your file and folder structure such that it does not exceed this limit. Splitting large drives that serve several scenarios into multiple smaller, more focused drives may help here.|



## Prepare your OneDrive environment

Before migrating your file share content, you must pre-provision your users in Office 365.  For guidance on pre-provisioning see: 
- [Prepare to provision users through directory synchronization to Office 365](/office365/enterprise/prepare-for-directory-synchronization)
- [Pre-provision OneDrive for users in your organization](/onedrive/pre-provision-accounts)






## Migrate

### Migration process
Below is a typical migration process that follows Microsoft’s best practices guidance.
1.	Select a small set of users for a pilot migration. The goal of the pilot is to validate the process, including performance, user communication, and to get a sample of user feedback.</br></br>
2.	Perform the pilot migration. This should use an incremental migration method, in which migration happens in the background with no user impact, followed by a cutover event in which network file shares and local file shares are disabled and they are directed to use the SharePoint or OneDrive environment. This method is preferred as it reduces user impact.</br></br>
3.	Understand the data from the pilot migration to determine the remainder of your migration schedule and make any changes. For example, you may update your user communication template to address a question you received from a pilot user.</br></br>
4.	Perform the remainder of the migration. This should also follow an incremental migration method, just like the pilot. Microsoft recommends a single cutover event for all users to switch to using their OneDrive accounts and SharePoint sites. This helps eliminate users from updating duplicate copies of content.</br></br>




### Migration offerings

## User Onboarding
Develop a plan to prepare your users for the upcoming change. Consideration factors to include in your plan: 
- **Evangelize the move.** Underscore the benefits, the collaborative capabilities, and the reasons for making the move.
- **End user training.**  Provide training to your users on the features in OneDrive.
- **Train your helpdesk.**  Before the cutover, train your helpdesk in key features and common user questions.
- **Prepare for any possible downtime** the migration may incur.
  
 Develop a plan for sending communications to your user base, providing clear statements of timing, expectations and impact to the individual. Include:

- The migration timeline and how it will impact them. Include any end user calls to action. 
- Assure them that if they have content already in OneDrive, that their content is safe and won’t be overwritten. 
- Let them know whether individuals can opt-out of the migration process
