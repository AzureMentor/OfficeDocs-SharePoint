## Planning and assessment

Planning is the key to a successful data migration.  The SharePoint Migration Assessment Tool (SMAT) is a simple command line executable that will scan the contents of your SharePoint Server 2013 farm to help identify any issues with data you plan to migrate to SharePoint Online. The results report points you to articles to help you fix any issues that were discovered. The tool runs in the background without impacting your production environment.
