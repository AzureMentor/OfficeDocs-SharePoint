# Monitor apps for your SharePoint Online environment

As a SharePoint or global admin in Office 365, you can monitor information such as app usage and error information for the apps that are in use in your SharePoint Online environment. Before you can monitor information about an app, you need to add it to the list of apps you want to monitor.
  
## Select apps to monitor

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.

App usage and error detail information is processed by different timer jobs that are pre-configured to run at set times for SharePoint Online. These timer jobs pick up events for the previous day. For this reason, the data visible on the Monitor Apps page may be delayed for up to 29 hours.
