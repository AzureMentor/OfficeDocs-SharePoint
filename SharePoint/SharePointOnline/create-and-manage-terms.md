# Create and manage terms in a term set

You can use the Term Store management tool to create terms in a term set, or manage a term such as copy it or move it. If you have many terms that you want to add, it might be more practical to import all the terms in the term set instead of adding the terms individually. For information about how to import terms, see [Import term sets](https://support.office.com/article/168fbc86-7fce-4288-9a1f-b83fc3921c18). 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  To create and manage terms in the Term Store management tool, you must be a Contributor, a Group Manager, or a Term Store Administrator. 
  
![You can select a group name in the Term Store management tool to open a menu that lets you add terms to a term set](media/f5f2bdaa-0bd1-441b-81a2-e732de310d97.png)
  
To create a term in a term set, follow these steps
  
> [!NOTE]
>  If you are adding a term to a local term set, you must start this procedure from the site to which the term set belongs. If you are updating a global term set, you can open the Term Store management tool from any site. 
  
1. Open the Term Store management tool. To learn how, see [Open the Term Store management tool](open-term-store-management-tool.md).
    
2. In the tree-view pane, expand the groups to find the term set to which you want to add a term.
    
3. Point to the term set where you want to add a term, select the arrow that appears, and then select **Create Term**.
    
4. Type the name that you want to use as the default label for the newly created term in the tree view.
    
5. In the **Properties** pane, specify the following information about the new term: 
    
6. **Available for tagging** Select the check box to make this term available for tagging. If you clear the check box, the term is visible but disabled in the tagging tools. 
    
7. **Language** Select the language for this label for the term. 
    
8. **Description** Type a description to help users understand how to apply this term, or to differentiate it from similar terms. 
    
9. **Default Label** Enter the word or phrase that you want to use as the default label for the term in this language. 
    
10. **Other Labels** Enter any synonyms for this term. To add multiple synonyms, type the first synonym and then press **ENTER** to add more lines.
