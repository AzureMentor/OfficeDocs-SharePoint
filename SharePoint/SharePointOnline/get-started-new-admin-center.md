# Get started with the new SharePoint admin center

The Home page of the new SharePoint admin center gives you an overview of SharePoint in your organization. To access the new SharePoint admin center:

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  
    
2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) 

3. If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.

## View reports

On the Home page, you can see at a glance:
  
- The number of files that have specific types of activity each day for the past 30 days. (If an activity occurs multiple times in one day on the same file, the file is counted only once for that day.)
    
- The number of total and active sites each day for the past 30 days. ("Active" sites are any where users view a page or view, modify, upload, download, share, or sync a file.)
