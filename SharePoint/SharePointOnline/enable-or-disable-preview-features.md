# Enable or disable preview features in SharePoint

The **Preview Features** setting in the SharePoint admin center lets you enable or disable integration with other services. The setting is enabled by default.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Preview Features** setting isn't related to the Targeted release option, which allows you to receive new updates and features as they become available. If you're interested in signing up for that, see [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options in Office 365](/office365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365). 
  
## What the Preview Features setting enables

Use the Preview Features setting to enable the following features, and others that are added in the future.
  
### Power BI integration with Excel on the web

When you use Power BI, your data is sent to the Power BI service. If you have implemented compliance policies for your SharePoint environment, these policies won't extend to the data as it's processed in Power BI. If this is a concern, select **Disable preview features** for this setting. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you disable preview features, your users will no longer be able to use Excel on the web to view and edit workbooks that rely on Power BI. 
  
## To enable or disable preview features for your organization

1. Sign in to https://admin.microsoft.com as a global or SharePoint admin. (If you see a message that you don't have permission to access the page, you don't have Office 365 administrator permissions in your organization.)
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you have Office 365 Germany, sign in at https://portal.office.de. If you have Office 365 operated by 21Vianet (China), sign in at https://login.partner.microsoftonline.cn/. Then select the Admin tile to open the admin center.  

2. In the left pane, under **Admin centers**, select **SharePoint**. (You might need to select **Show all** to see the list of admin centers.) If the classic SharePoint admin center appears, select **Open it now** at the top of the page to open the new SharePoint admin center.

3. Select **Settings** in the left pane.
 
4. At the bottom of the page, select **classic settings page**.
  
5. Next to **Preview Features**, select **Enable preview features** or **Disable preview features**.
