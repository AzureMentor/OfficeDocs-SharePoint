# Configure hybrid OneDrive for Business - roadmap

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md.md)]
  
This article provides the roadmap for configuring OneDrive for Business hybrid, which allows your users to use OneDrive for Business in Office 365 with SharePoint Server.
  
Follow these steps in the order shown. If you already completed a step when you did a different roadmap, skip that step and go to the next.
  
|**Step**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**1. [Configure Office 365 for SharePoint hybrid](configure-office-365-for-sharepoint-hybrid.md)** <br/> |Configure your Office 365 tenant for a hybrid environment, including registering your domain, configuring UPN suffixes, and synchronizing your user accounts.  <br/> |
|**2. [Set up SharePoint services for hybrid environments](set-up-sharepoint-services-for-hybrid-environments.md)** <br/> |Configure the needed SharePoint services for hybrid search, including User Profiles, MySites, and the Application Management service.  <br/> |
|**3. (SharePoint Server 2013 only)[Install Service Pack 1 for SharePoint Server 2013](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=521936)** <br/> |Be sure you've installed at least Service Pack 1 on your SharePoint Server 2013 farm or the OneDrive for Business redirect option will not be available.  <br/> |
|**4. [Redirect OneDrive for Business users to Office 365](configure-hybrid-onedrive-for-business.md)** <br/> |Configure hybrid OneDrive for Business in the SharePoint Central Administration website.  <br/> |
|**5. Quick test** <br/> | Check to make sure OneDrive for Business is being redirected to Office 365:  <br/>  Log in to a SharePoint Server as a regular user. (Be sure you're a member of the correct audience if you used audiences.)  <br/>  Click **OneDrive** in the app launcher.  <br/>  The URL in the browser address bar should change from that of your on-premises farm, to the personal site URL of SharePoint Online.  <br/> |
