# Plan hybrid OneDrive for Business

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md.md)]

In SharePoint Server, you can redirect users to OneDrive for Business in Office 365 when they choose **OneDrive** in the navigation bar (SharePoint Server 2010 and SharePoint Server 2013) or in the app launcher (SharePoint Server 2016). This is known as hybrid OneDrive for Business.
  
With this feature, you can continue to use your on-premises SharePoint farm while providing your users with an easy way to store, share, and collaborate in the cloud with OneDrive for Business in Office 365. This best-of-both-worlds approach lets you keep your key business information in your own environment while allowing users the flexibility to access their documents from anywhere.
  
## How it works

With hybrid OneDrive for Business your users can:
  
- Store personal files they are working on in the cloud, and access these files even when they aren't signed in to your corporate network.
    
- Access these files on devices such as iPhones, Windows Phones, tablets, and so on.
    
- Share and collaborate on documents with others in your organization or with external users by using guest links.
    
As an IT pro, you can:
  
- Provide cloud storage for your users.
    
- Add storage for your users in the cloud in 25-100 gigabytes (GB) increments, as needed.
    
- Continue to provide SharePoint features as usual in your on-premises farm.
    
 **Things to keep in mind**
  
To avoid user confusion, keep the following in mind when you turn on hybrid OneDrive for Business:
  
- When you turn on this feature, your users will be directed to OneDrive for Business in Office 365 when they click OneDrive in SharePoint Server. Be sure to plan to migrate your users' content from their old SharePoint Server OneDrive for Business to the new one in Office 365.
    
- Because there's no direct link between OneDrive for Business in SharePoint Server and OneDrive for Business in Office 365, users' **Shared with me** lists in Office 365 won't display documents that have been shared with them from on-premises SharePoint Server. 
    
## Getting started
