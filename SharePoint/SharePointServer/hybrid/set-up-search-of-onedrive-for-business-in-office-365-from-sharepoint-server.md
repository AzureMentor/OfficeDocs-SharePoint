# Set up Search of OneDrive for Business in Office 365 from SharePoint Server

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md.md)]
  
After you install Service Pack 1 for SharePoint Server, when your users click **OneDrive** or **Sites** on the navigation bar, you can redirect them to OneDrive for Business in Office 365 for professionals and small businesses. To learn how to do this, see [Plan hybrid OneDrive for Business](/sharepoint/hybrid/plan-hybrid-onedrive-for-business).
  
This article describes how you can then set up an option in the SharePoint Server enterprise Search Center to return only search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365. This option, called a search vertical, will provide an easy way for a user of on-premises SharePoint Server to search only the following items in OneDrive for Business in Office 365 for a match to the user's search query:
  
- Items that the user has stored in OneDrive for Business in Office 365
    
- Items in OneDrive for Business in Office 365 that are shared with the user
    
- Items in OneDrive for Business in Office 365 that are shared with everyone
    
## How users will access the OneDrive for Business search vertical

A search vertical filters search results so that only a certain subset of all relevant results is displayed. SharePoint Server provides four preconfigured search verticals: **Everything**, **People**, **Conversations**, and **Videos**. You can see the links for these search verticals in the Search Navigation Web Part, which is below the search box on a search-results page, as shown in the following screen capture.
  
![The four default search verticals in an Enterprise Search Center](../media/BoxCutterSearch-4SearchVerticals.jpg)
  
When a user enters a search query in the search box and then clicks one of the search-vertical links, the Search system returns search results that correspond to that search vertical only. For example, if the user enters Azure in the search box and then selects the **Videos** search-vertical link, the Search system will return only search results that are videos related to Azure. 
  
In this article, in the SharePoint Server deployment, you will create a search vertical for OneDrive for Business in Office 365. You will then add a link in the enterprise Search Center for the new search vertical. The link in the enterprise Search Center will look something like this, depending on what you name it.
  
![A OneDrive search vertical and the four default search verticals in an Enterprise Search Center](../media/BoxCutterSearch-5SearchVerticals.jpg)
  
After that, when users of on-premises SharePoint Server type queries in the search box in the enterprise Search Center and they click the OneDrive for Business search-vertical link that you created, they will get search results only from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365.
  
## Setting up Search of OneDrive for Business by creating a OneDrive search vertical

To create a search vertical in your SharePoint Server deployment that will enable users to search only for items that are in OneDrive for Business in Office 365, you perform the following procedures, which are described in detail in this article:.
  
![Steps to create a search vertical in SharePoint Server 2013 for OneDrive for Business in Office 365](../media/BoxCutterSearchVerticalProcess.jpg)
  
That is, in your SharePoint Server deployment, you do the following:
  
- [Step 1: Create a result source that specifies OneDrive for Business in Office 365 as the content repository to get search results from](#BKMK_CreateResultSource)
    
- [Step 2: Create a search-results page for the OneDrive for Business search vertical](#BKMK_CreateSearchResultsPage)
    
- [Step 3: Configure the Search Results Web Part to display results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365](#BKMK_ConfigureSearchResultsWebPart)
    
- [Step 4: Create a link in the Search Center for the OneDrive for Business search vertical](#BKMK_CreateLinkInSearchCenter)
    
- [Step 5: Test your configuration for using the OneDrive search vertical to display search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365](#BKMK_TestConfig)
    
## Before you begin

Before you perform the procedures in this article, make sure that you do each of the following:
  
- Complete the procedures in [Configure hybrid OneDrive for Business](configure-hybrid-onedrive-for-business.md).
    
- Configure a hybrid SharePoint environment according to the instructions in the following two articles, and in the following order:
    
1. [Configure hybrid federated search from SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online - roadmap](configure-hybrid-federated-search-sharepoint-serverroadmap.md)
    
2. [Configure server-to-server authentication from SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online](configure-server-to-server-authentication.md)
    
    For additional information about synchronizing users and passwords, see [Ways to synchronize users and passwords](configure-hybrid-onedrive-for-business.md) in [Configure hybrid OneDrive for Business](configure-hybrid-onedrive-for-business.md).
    
- Create an enterprise Search Center in your SharePoint Server deployment if one does not already exist. For more information, see [Create a Search Center site in SharePoint Server](../search/create-a-search-center-site.md).
    
## Step 1: Create a result source that specifies OneDrive for Business in Office 365 as the content repository to get search results from
<a name="BKMK_CreateResultSource"> </a>

In this procedure, you create a result source in the SharePoint Server deployment. This result source is a definition that specifies the URL and path in Office 365 to get search results from, the protocol for getting those results, and several other related settings.
  
A result source can be created at the Search service application level, the site collection level, or the site level. In this procedure, you create the result source at the Search service application level. This makes the result source available to any query rule that is created at the Search service application level in that Search service application and to any query rule that is created for a site collection or site that is in a web application that consumes the Search service application.
  
 **To create the result source**
  
1. Verify that the user account that you use to perform this procedure is an administrator for the Search service application that you want to configure.
    
2. In the SharePoint Server deployment, in Central Administration, in the **Application Management** section, click **Manage service applications**.
    
3. Click the Search service application to which you want to add a result source.
    
4. On the  _Search_service_application_name_:Search Administration page for the Search service application, in the Quick Launch, click **Result Sources**.
    
5. On the  _Search_service_application_name_:Manage Result Sources page, click **New Result Source**.
    
6. On the  _Search_service_application_name_:Add Result Source page, do the following:
    
1. In the **Name** box, type a name for the new result sourceâ€”for example, Results from OneDrive in Office 365.
    
2. (Optional) In the **Description** box, type a description of the new result source. 
    
    This description will appear as a tooltip when the pointer rests on the result source on certain configuration pages.
    
3. In the **Protocol** section, select **Remote SharePoint**.
    
4. In the **Remote Service URL** section, type the address of the root site collection in SharePoint Online that you want to get search results from. 
    
    The address of the root site collection in SharePoint Online is typically of the form https:// _tenant_name_.sharepoint.com, where  _tenant_name_ is the name of the Office 365 tenant. 
    
5. In the **Type** section, select **SharePoint Search Results**.
    
6. In the **Query Transform** section, after **{searchTerms}**, type a space and then type the following:
    
    path:https:// _tenant_name_-my.sharepoint.com/personal
    
    In general, you can use a query transform to narrow search results to a specified subset. In this case, you use a query transform to specify the Path property, which narrows search results to documents that are in OneDrive for Business in Office 365. For more information about query transforms, see the following resources:
    
  - [Transforming queries in result sources](../search/plan-to-transform-queries-and-order-results.md#Trans_Result_Sources) in [Plan to transform queries and order results in SharePoint Server](../search/plan-to-transform-queries-and-order-results.md)
    
  - [Query variables in SharePoint Server](../technical-reference/query-variables.md)
    
7. In the **Credentials Information** section, select **Default Authentication**.
    
    Your settings on the  _Search_service_application_name_:Add Result Source page then look something like this:
    
     ![screen shot of Add Result Source page in SharePoint Server 2013](../media/BoxCutterSearch-AddResultSource.jpg)
  
8. Click **OK** to save the new result source. 
    
## Step 2: Create a search-results page for the OneDrive for Business search vertical
<a name="BKMK_CreateSearchResultsPage"> </a>

Each search vertical can have its own search-results page on which results for that vertical are displayed. In the following procedure, you create the search-results page that will display results for the OneDrive for Business search vertical.
  
 **To create the search-results page for the OneDrive for Business search vertical**
  
1. Verify that the user account that you use to perform this procedure is a site collection administrator or site owner for the enterprise Search Center.
    
2. In the SharePoint Server deployment, browse to the enterprise Search Center.
    
    The URL of the enterprise Search Center is typically of the form http:// _host_name_/sites/ _Search_Center_name_.
    
3. Go to **Settings** > **Site Contents** > **Pages**.
    
    This Pages page contains a list of all of the search-results pages for the enterprise Search Center.
    
4. From the Pages page, add a new search-results page by doing the following:
    
1. On the ribbon, click the **Files** tab. 
    
2. Click **New Document**, and then click **Page**.
    
     ![screen shot of ribbon on Search Center>Settings>Site Contents>Pages page](../media/BoxCutterSearch-AddSearchResultsPage.jpg)
  
5. On the Create Page page, do the following:
    
1. In the **Title** box, enter a title for the new search-results page, such as OneDriveResults.
    
2. (Optional) In the **Description** box, enter a description for the new page. 
    
3. In the **URL** box, enter the portion of the URL that you want to use to identify the page, such as OneDriveResults.
    
4. In the **Page Layout** section, ensure that **(Welcome Page) Search Results** is selected. 
    
    This specifies how the new search-results page will be displayed.
    
    Your settings on the Create Page page then look something like this:
    
     ![screen shot of Create Search Results page](../media/BoxCutterSearch-CreateSearchResultsPage.jpg)
  
5. Click **Create**.
    
6. On the page that contains a list of all of the search-results pages for the enterprise Search Center, do the following:
    
1. Select the icon next to the name of the search-results page (such as **OneDriveResults**) that you just created.
    
    This selects that row in the list of search-results pages.
    
2. On the **Files** tab, in the **Open &amp; Check Out** section, select **Check In**.
    
3. In the **Check in** dialog box, do the following: 
    
1. In the **Version** field, select **1.0 Major Version (publish)**.

3. (Optional) In the **Comments** field, enter comments as appropriate for your configuration. 
    
4. Click **OK**.
    
    This checks in and publishes the page.
    
## Step 3: Configure the Search Results Web Part to display results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365
<a name="BKMK_ConfigureSearchResultsWebPart"> </a>

In this procedure, you configure the Search Results Web Part on the search-results page that you created in the previous procedure in this article (Step 2). You configure the Search Results Web Part to display search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365.
  
 **To configure the Search Results Web Part to display search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365**
  
1. Verify that the user account that you use to perform this procedure is a site collection administrator or site owner for the enterprise Search Center.
    
2. Go to the page that has a list of all of the search-results pages for the enterprise Search Center.
    
    You accessed this page in the previous procedure in this article (Step 2). To reach it again, browse to the enterprise Search Center, and then go to **Settings** > **Site Contents** > **Pages**. The URL of the page might resemble http:// _host_name_/sites/ _Search_Center_name_/Pages/Forms/AllItems.aspx.
    
3. Click the name of the search-results page (such as **OneDriveResults**) that you created, checked in, and published in the previous procedure in this article (Step 2).
    
    Clicking the name of the search-results page will take you to that page.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > On the search-results page, you might see the message **Sorry, something went wrong**, or the message **Nothing here matches your search**. These are default messages that can be displayed on the search-results page when a user search fails. These messages do not apply to the configuration that you are currently doing. 
  
4. Go to **Settings** > **Edit page**.
    
5. On the ribbon, click the **PAGE** tab. 
    
6. On the **PAGE** tab, in the Search Results Web Part, move the pointer to the right until you see the down arrow, and then click the arrow. 
    
    The **Search Results** Web Part menu appears. 
    
7. On the **Search Results** Web Part menu, choose **Edit Web Part**.
    
     ![screen shot of Search Results Web Part menu](../media/BoxCutterSearch-EditSearchResultsWebPart.jpg)
  
    The Search Results Web Part tool pane then appears at the top right of the page that you are editing.
    
8. In the Search Results Web Part tool pane, click **Change query**.
    
     ![screen shot of Change Query button in Search Results Web Part tool pane](../media/BoxCutterSearch-SearchResultsWebPartChangeQuery.jpg)
  
9. In the **Build Your Query** dialog box, do the following: 
    
1. In the **Select a query** section, on the drop-down menu, select the result source that you created in the first procedure of this article, such as **Results from OneDrive in Office 365**.
    
    This causes search results from OneDrive for Business in Office 365 to appear in the Search Results Web Part on the OneDriveResults search-results page.
    
2. Skip the other sections in the dialog box, and then click **OK**.
    
10. On the **PAGE** tab, in the **Edit** group, click **Check In**.
    
11. In the **Check In** dialog box, do the following:

2. In the **Publish** dialog box, optionally type comments as appropriate for your configuration, and then click **Continue**.
    
## Step 4: Create a link in the Search Center for the OneDrive for Business search vertical
<a name="BKMK_CreateLinkInSearchCenter"> </a>

In this procedure, you create the link in the SharePoint Server enterprise Search Center that users will click to get results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365. After you create the link, it appears in the Search Navigation Web Part, under the search box next to the links for the other search verticals, such as **Everything** and **People**. The links in the Search Navigation Web Part then look something like this, depending on your particular configuration:
  
![A OneDrive search vertical and the four default search verticals in an Enterprise Search Center](../media/BoxCutterSearch-5SearchVerticals.jpg)
  
 **To create the link for the OneDrive for Business search vertical**
  
1. Verify that the user account that you use to perform this procedure is a site collection administrator or site owner for the enterprise Search Center in the SharePoint Server deployment.
    
2. Browse to the enterprise Search Center in the SharePoint Server deployment.
    
    The URL of the enterprise Search Center is typically of the form http:// _host_name_/sites/ _Search_Center_name_.
    
3. Go to **Settings** > **Site Settings**.
    
4. On the Site Settings page, in the **Search** section, click **Search Settings**.
    
     ![screen shot of Search section on Search Center Site Settings page](../media/BoxCutterSearch-SiteSettingsPageSearchSection.jpg)
  
5. On the Search Settings page, do the following:
    
1. (Optional) In the **Enter a Search Center URL** section, in the **Search Center URL** box, type the URL of the enterprise Search Center. 
    
    If you type a URL in this box, after a user performs a search from a search box on another site, the Search system displays a link that the user can click to try the search again from the enterprise Search Center.
    
2. In the **Which search results page should queries be sent to?** section, select **Use the same results page as my parent**.
    
3. In the **Configure Search Navigation** section, select **Add Link**.
    
4. In the **Navigation Link** dialog box, do the following: 
    
     ![screen shot of Navigation Link Dialog Box](../media/BoxCutterSearch-NavLinkDialogBox.jpg)
  
1. In the **Title** box, type the text (such as MyOneDrive) that you want to use for the search-vertical link in the enterprise Search Center that will take users to the search-results page that you created in the second procedure (Step 2) in this article.
    
2. In the **URL** box, do one of the following: 
    
  - Type the relative path to the search-results page that you created in the previous procedure, such as /sites/ _Search_Center_name_/Pages/onedriveresults.aspx.
    
  - Click **Browse**.
    
  - In the list of search-results pages, click the name of the search-results page for the new search vertical, and then click **Insert**.
    
3. Select the **Open link in new window** check box if you want the search-results page for OneDrive for Business to open in a new window when users click the link for that search vertical. 
    
4. (Optional) In the **Description** box, type a description for the new link. 
    
5. (Optional) In the **Audience** box, type the name of a global audience, a SharePoint group, a distribution group, or a security group to which access to the new search-results page will be limited. 
    
    **All Site users** is the default value if you do not type anything in the **Audience** box. The value **All site users** allows access to all users who can access the Search Center site. For more information, see "To grant access to the SharePoint Search Center" in [Create a Search Center site in SharePoint Server](../search/create-a-search-center-site.md).
    
6. If you typed a value in the **Audience** box, then next to that box, click the **Check Names** icon to make sure that SharePoint Server recognizes the audience that you typed.

5. In the **Configure Search Navigation** section, click the name of the new link, such as **MyOneDrive**, and then click **Move Up** or **Move Down** as appropriate to position the new link where you want it to appear in the group of search-vertical links. 
    
6. Click **OK**.
    
## Step 5: Test your configuration for using the OneDrive search vertical to display search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365
<a name="BKMK_TestConfig"> </a>

Federated users should now be able to use the new MyOneDrive search vertical to get results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365. Searches that federated users perform in the new search vertical should return the following items from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365 that match the search query:
  
- Items that the user has stored in OneDrive for Business in Office 365
    
- Items in OneDrive for Business in Office 365 that are shared with the user
    
- Items in OneDrive for Business in Office 365 that are shared with everyone
    
A federated user is one who has an account in the on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) Domain Users group that has been synchronized with Azure Active Directory by using the Azure Active Directory Sync tool (DirSync). The account has group memberships and permissions for resources in the SharePoint Server deployment and in Office 365, and can access resources in both environments by authenticating with the federation identity provider, such as Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0. 
  
To validate your configuration for displaying search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365, you can log on to SharePoint Server as a federated user and try some searches from the OneDrive for Business search vertical in the enterprise Search Center. Use the following procedure to validate your configuration in this way.
  
 **To test your configuration for displaying search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365**
  
1. Log on to the SharePoint Server deployment as a federated user who has been activated in Office 365, and who has permission to view the root site collection in SharePoint Online in Office 365.
    
2. Browse to the enterprise Search Center in the SharePoint Server deployment.
    
    The URL of the enterprise Search Center might resemble http:// _host_name_/sites/ _Search_Center_name_.
    
3. In the enterprise Search Center, do the following:
    
1. In the search box, type a test search query, such as the name of your company.
    
    Make sure that it's a query that should yield some search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365.
    
2. Press Enter or click the search icon, and then wait for initial search results to be displayed.
    
3. After the initial search results are displayed, click the link for the search vertical for OneDrive for Business that you created earlier in this article.
    
4. On the search-results page, confirm that you see results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365.
    
5. If you do not see results from OneDrive for Business in Office 365 on the search-results page, do the following:
    
1. Verify each of the following:
    
1. You configured the hybrid SharePoint environment as described in the following articles, and in the following order:
    
1. [Configure hybrid federated search from SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online - roadmap](configure-hybrid-federated-search-sharepoint-serverroadmap.md)
    
2. [Configure server-to-server authentication from SharePoint Server to SharePoint Online](configure-server-to-server-authentication.md)
    
2. You completed the procedures described in [Configure hybrid OneDrive for Business](configure-hybrid-onedrive-for-business.md).
    
3. You completed the previous procedures described in this article.
    
2. Correct any errors or omissions, and try a search again.
    
3. If you still do not see search results from OneDrive for Business that is in Office 365, check the SharePoint Unified Logging Service (ULS) logs, also called SharePoint trace logs.
    
    For more information, see [Overview of Unified Logging System (ULS) Logging](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=393137).
