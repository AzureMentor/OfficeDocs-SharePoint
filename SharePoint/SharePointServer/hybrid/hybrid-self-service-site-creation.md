# Hybrid self-service site creation

[!INCLUDE[appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md](../includes/appliesto-2013-2016-2019-SPO-md.md)]

Hybrid self-service site creation redirects the default self-service site creation page in SharePoint Server (/_layouts/15/scsignup.aspx) or (/_layouts/16/scsignup.aspx) to the SharePoint Online Group Creation page. By configuring this feature, you can help your users to create their sites in SharePoint Online instead of SharePoint Server.
  
Hybrid self-service site creation respects your hybrid audience settings. If you use a hybrid audience, members of the hybrid audience will be redirected to SharePoint Online for self-service site creation, while on-premises only users will continue to be directed to self-service site creation in SharePoint Server.
  
This setting can be configured independently for each web application in your farm.
  
Hybrid self-service site creation is available in SharePoint Server 2013 with the March 2017 PU. <br> Hybrid self-service site creation is available in SharePoint 2016 with November 2017 PU. 
  
## Configure hybrid self-service site creation using the Hybrid Picker

Configuring hybrid self-service site creation is done by using the hybrid picker in the SharePoint Online admin center.
  
> [!NOTE]
> If you've previously configured other hybrid features with the hybrid picker, you can go directly to the SharePoint Central Administration website to manage hybrid self-service site creation. In this case, the hybrid connection has been made and there's no need to run the hybrid picker again. 
  
 **To configure hybrid self-service site creation**
  
1. Log on to a server in your SharePoint Server farm as the farm administrator. 
    
2. From your SharePoint Server computer, open a web browser and log on to Office 365 as a global administrator.
    
3. In the SharePoint Online Admin Center, click **configure hybrid**.
    
4. On the hybrid picker page, click **Hybrid Picker**.
    
5. Follow the wizard and choose **Hybrid self-service site creation** when prompted. 
    
6. When prompted, choose the web application with which you want to use hybrid self-service site creation.
    
When the hybrid picker wizard completes, hybrid self-service site creation will be enabled for the web application that you selected.
  
## Manage hybrid self-service site creation

Once you have configured hybrid self-service site creation, you can manage it in the SharePoint Central Administration website.
  
 **To manage hybrid self-service site creation**
  
1. In Central Administration, click **Application Management**.
    
2. On the Application Management page, under **Site Collections**, click **Configure self-service site creation**.
    
3. In the **Web Application** section, select the web application where you want to manage hybrid self-service site creation, and then select or clear the **Create Site Collections in SharePoint Online** check box. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > While hybrid users of this web application will be redirected to SharePoint Online for self-service site creation, the other settings on this page continue to apply to any on-premises only users. 
  
4. Click **OK**.
